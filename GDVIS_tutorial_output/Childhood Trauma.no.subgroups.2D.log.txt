Check whether subgroups are genetically different
------------------------------------------------------------
When there is no suggested evidence of significant difference between subgroups, the triangle will not be plotted. Specifically, when rg is not significantly different from 1 (filter 1a) AND h2.sub1 is not clearly different from h2.sub2 (filter 1b and 1c), the triangle will not be plotted. In some occasions, a triangle will not be plotted while it would have been plotted with larger GWAS sample sizes (and therefore smaller standard errors). 
    
Filter 1a:
The genetic correlation between CT.yes_controls' and 'CT.no_controls' is not significantly different from 1
The upper bound is calculated as 0.9 (the genetic correlation) + 1.96 * 0.06 (se) = 1.0176
    
Filter 1b:
The heritability of 'CT.yes_controls' does not lie within the confidence intervals of the heritability of 'CT.no_controls'
The heritability of CT.yes_controls is 0.1606, the interval of CT.no_controls is (0.12 - 0.16)
    
Filter 1c:
The heritability of 'CT.no_controls' lies within the confidence intervals of the heritability of 'CT.yes_controls'
The heritability of 'CT.no_controls' is 0.14, the interval is (0.133 - 0.188)
    
--> Filter 1 is passed: subgroups are genetically different from each other
    
Filter 2:
The heritability of 'CT.yes_controls' is significantly different from 0
The heritability is 0.1606 with a lower bound of the confidence interval of 0.133
--> Filter 2 is passed
    
Filter 3:
The heritability of 'CT.no_controls' is significantly different from 0
The heritabiltiy is 0.14 where the lower bound of the confidence interval is 0.12
--> Filter 3 is passed
