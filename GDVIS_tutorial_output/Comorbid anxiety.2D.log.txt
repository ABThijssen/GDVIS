Check whether subgroups are genetically different
------------------------------------------------------------
When there is no suggested evidence of significant difference between subgroups, the triangle will not be plotted. Specifically, when rg is not significantly different from 1 (filter 1a) AND h2.sub1 is not clearly different from h2.sub2 (filter 1b and 1c), the triangle will not be plotted. In some occasions, a triangle will not be plotted while it would have been plotted with larger GWAS sample sizes (and therefore smaller standard errors). 
    
Filter 1a:
The genetic correlation between With anxiety_MDD controls' and 'without anxiety_MDD controls' is significantly different from 1
The upper bound is calculated as 0.8451 (the genetic correlation) + 1.96 * 0.072 (se) = 0.98622
    
Filter 1b:
The heritability of 'With anxiety_MDD controls' does not lie within the confidence intervals of the heritability of 'without anxiety_MDD controls'
The heritability of With anxiety_MDD controls is 0.1394, the interval of without anxiety_MDD controls is (0.061 - 0.099)
    
Filter 1c:
The heritability of 'without anxiety_MDD controls' does not lie within the confidence intervals of the heritability of 'With anxiety_MDD controls'
The heritability of 'without anxiety_MDD controls' is 0.0798, the interval is (0.111 - 0.168)
    
--> Filter 1 is passed: subgroups are genetically different from each other
    
Filter 2:
The heritability of 'With anxiety_MDD controls' is significantly different from 0
The heritability is 0.1394 with a lower bound of the confidence interval of 0.111
--> Filter 2 is passed
    
Filter 3:
The heritability of 'without anxiety_MDD controls' is significantly different from 0
The heritabiltiy is 0.0798 where the lower bound of the confidence interval is 0.061
--> Filter 3 is passed
    
    
Optional double checks
------------------------------------------------------------
Double check 1:
GDVIS calculated the heritability of With anxiety versus without anxiety as 0.0409
The LDSC estimated value provided as input is 0.045 (se = 0.0166)
The GDVIS value lies within the 95% CI 0.045 +- 1.96 * 0.0166.
The difference between 0.0409 and 0.045 is -0.0041, this is -0.245 * se.
    
Double check 2:
GDVIS calculated the heritability of allcases versus MDD controls as 0.0933
No optional input for this check was provided. 
    
Double check 3a:
GDVIS calculated the genetic correlation between With anxiety.vs.MDD controls and With anxiety.vs.without anxiety as 0.6654
The LDSC estimated value provided as input is 0.6503 (se = 0.0752)
The GDVIS value lies within the 95% CI +- 1.96 * 0.0752.
The difference between 0.6654 and 0.6503 is 0.0151, this is 0.2014 * se.
    
Double check 3b:
GDVIS calculated the genetic correlation between without anxiety.vs.MDD controls and With anxiety.vs.without anxiety as 0.1633
The LDSC estimated value provided as input is 0.1302 (se = 0.187)
The GDVIS value lies within the 95%  CI +- 1.96 * 0.0752.
The difference between 0.1633 and 0.1302 is 0.0331, this is 0.177 * se.
    
Double check 4a:
GDVIS calculated the genetic correlation between allcases.vs.MDD controls and With anxiety.vs.MDD controls as 0.9535
The LDSC estimated value provided as input is 0.9504 (se = 0.0235)
The GDVIS value lies within the 95% CI +- 1.96 * 0.0235.
The difference between 0.9535 and 0.9504 is 0.0031, this is -0.245 * se.
    
Double check 4b:
GDVIS calculated the genetic correlation between allcases.vs.MDD controls and without anxiety.vs.MDD controls is calculated to be 0.9669
The LDSC estimated value provided as input is 0.9686 (se = 0.0153)
The GDVIS value lies within the CI +- 1.96 * 0.0153.
The difference between 0.9669 and 0.9686 is -0.0017, this is -0.245 * se.
