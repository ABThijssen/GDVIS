Check whether subgroups are genetically different
------------------------------------------------------------
When there is no suggested evidence of significant difference between subgroups, the triangle will not be plotted. Specifically, when rg is not significantly different from 1 (filter 1a) AND h2.sub1 is not clearly different from h2.sub2 (filter 1b and 1c), the triangle will not be plotted. In some occasions, a triangle will not be plotted while it would have been plotted with larger GWAS sample sizes (and therefore smaller standard errors). 
    
Filter 1a:
The genetic correlation between With childhood trauma_MDD controls' and 'without childhood trauma_MDD controls' is significantly different from 1
The upper bound is calculated as 0.6011 (the genetic correlation) + 1.96 * 0.061 (se) = 0.72066
    
Filter 1b:
The heritability of 'With childhood trauma_MDD controls' does not lie within the confidence intervals of the heritability of 'without childhood trauma_MDD controls'
The heritability of With childhood trauma_MDD controls is 0.1606, the interval of without childhood trauma_MDD controls is (0.065 - 0.103)
    
Filter 1c:
The heritability of 'without childhood trauma_MDD controls' does not lie within the confidence intervals of the heritability of 'With childhood trauma_MDD controls'
The heritability of 'without childhood trauma_MDD controls' is 0.0839, the interval is (0.133 - 0.188)
    
--> Filter 1 is passed: subgroups are genetically different from each other
    
Filter 2:
The heritability of 'With childhood trauma_MDD controls' is significantly different from 0
The heritability is 0.1606 with a lower bound of the confidence interval of 0.133
--> Filter 2 is passed
    
Filter 3:
The heritability of 'without childhood trauma_MDD controls' is significantly different from 0
The heritabiltiy is 0.0839 where the lower bound of the confidence interval is 0.065
--> Filter 3 is passed
    
    
Optional double checks
------------------------------------------------------------
Double check 1:
GDVIS calculated the heritability of With childhood trauma versus without childhood trauma as 0.1049
The LDSC estimated value provided as input is 0.1036 (se = 0.0162)
The GDVIS value lies within the 95% CI 0.1036 +- 1.96 * 0.0162.
The difference between 0.1049 and 0.1036 is 0.0013, this is 0.0833 * se.
    
Double check 2:
GDVIS calculated the heritability of allcases versus MDD controls as 0.0934
No optional input for this check was provided. 
    
Double check 3a:
GDVIS calculated the genetic correlation between With childhood trauma.vs.MDD controls and With childhood trauma.vs.without childhood trauma as 0.6996
The LDSC estimated value provided as input is 0.6995 (se = 0.0389)
The GDVIS value lies within the 95% CI +- 1.96 * 0.0389.
The difference between 0.6996 and 0.6995 is 1e-04, this is 0.0022 * se.
    
Double check 3b:
GDVIS calculated the genetic correlation between without childhood trauma.vs.MDD controls and With childhood trauma.vs.without childhood trauma as -0.1505
The LDSC estimated value provided as input is -0.1544 (se = 0.0983)
The GDVIS value lies within the 95%  CI +- 1.96 * 0.0389.
The difference between -0.1505 and -0.1544 is 0.0039, this is 0.0394 * se.
    
Double check 4a:
GDVIS calculated the genetic correlation between allcases.vs.MDD controls and With childhood trauma.vs.MDD controls as 0.9142
The LDSC estimated value provided as input is 0.9111 (se = 0.0167)
The GDVIS value lies within the 95% CI +- 1.96 * 0.0167.
The difference between 0.9142 and 0.9111 is 0.0031, this is 0.0833 * se.
    
Double check 4b:
GDVIS calculated the genetic correlation between allcases.vs.MDD controls and without childhood trauma.vs.MDD controls is calculated to be 0.8734
The LDSC estimated value provided as input is 0.8765 (se = 0.0198)
The GDVIS value lies within the CI +- 1.96 * 0.0198.
The difference between 0.8734 and 0.8765 is -0.0031, this is 0.0833 * se.
